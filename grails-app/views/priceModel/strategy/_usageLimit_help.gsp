<p>In this pricing model, expected consumption is expressed as upper and lower limit on a specific figure. Means instead of providing exact figure, expected consumption is expressed in terms of range. For example, expected usage is 1500 and upper & lower limits are 110% and 90%. It means if usage in between 1350 to 1650 then rate will be calculated with expected rates. If usage is below lower limit, there will be different rate for whole usage. Same for upper limit. Reseller needs to provide information in form of csv to system.</p>
